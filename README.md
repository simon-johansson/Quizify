Starts the express and the webpack-dev-server (which has livereload and hot loading).

Boilerplate has been generated using [`generator-react-webpack`](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack). Use the following generators to create new components, actions or stores with corresponding test.

* [react-webpack:component \<NAME> --rich](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack#component)
* [react-webpack:action \<NAME>](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack#action) (Reflux style action)
* [react-webpack:store \<NAME>](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack#store) (Reflux style store)

## Noteworthy

* **Proxy** - A proxy is needed in order to have both the express and the webpack-dev-server running properly, [info](http://www.christianalfoni.com/articles/2015_04_19_The-ultimate-webpack-setup).
